- Played a pivotal role in the development of ASGARD, an in-house Spark-based data warehouse solution built using Java SpringBoot, Spark, Kubernetes and Azure technologies.

- Designed and integrated non-blocking asynchronous querying feature in ASGARD, enabling the execution of batch jobs. This innovation allowed Akamai to completely transition away from the existing Snowflake infrastructure, resulting in substantial cost savings.

- Enhanced ASGARD's query API by implementing query statistics collection, providing valuable insights into metrics such as IO and processing times, as well as data transfer volumes. These insights were leveraged to optimize query performance and improve overall efficiency.

- Developed alerts and monitoring dashboards using Prometheus Alertmanager, Slack, and Grafana. This enhanced the observability of the system, enabling proactive identification and resolution of potential issues.

- Developed and implemented an automated process utilizing C++ and Python to rotate SSL certificates for a large network of approximately 3000 nodes. This solution ensured uninterrupted data communication with zero downtime, significantly reducing the need for manual interventions and saving valuable time for the DevOps team.

- Throughout this experience, I utilized my strong skills in Java, Springboot, Kubernetes, Azure, C++, Python, Linux, SQL, software development, and Agile methodologies to successfully deliver these projects.
